Exercise 1:

Select all rows from the "Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader" table

Include the following columns in your output:

 - OrderDate
 - SubTotal

Exercise 3:

Modify your query from Exercise 2 such that you are NOT including $10,000 and $30,000 
in your range of subtotals, but still including all amounts between these numbers. 
In other words, the range should no longer be "inclusive".
