Exercise 1:

Write a query that selects all rows from the "Purchasing.PurchaseOrderDetail" table 
where the line total is greater than $10,000. Include the following columns in your output:

 - PurchaseOrderID
 - PurchaseOrderDetailID
 - OrderQty

Exercise 2:

Write a similar query that selects all rows from the "Sales.SalesOrderDetail" table where 
the line total is greater than $10,000. Include the following columns in your output:

 - SalesOrderID
 - SalesOrderDetailID

Exercise 3:

Combine the rows from your Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 queries by "stacking" them vertically. 
Make sure the similar fields from each table align. 
Alias the first two columns as "OrderID" and "OrderDetailID", respectively.

Exercise 4:

Add the following derived fields to your query; 
remember , you'll need to add them to both components of your query.
Sort the output of your query by line total in descending order.

 - "RunDate" - displays the current date
 - "OrderType" - this should display the string "Purchase" for purchase orders, 
	and "Sale" for sales orders.
