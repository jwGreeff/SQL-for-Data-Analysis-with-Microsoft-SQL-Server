/*
Exercise 3

There are a LOT of text functions in SQL. 
More than you could possibly scrunch into a single course or book 
without it turning into an encyclopedia. 
As such, you will frequently find yourself using Google or Bing to look up functions 
that accomplish specific tasks. Let's practice that here.

Select the "FirstName" column from the "Person.Person" table (all rows). 
Now add the following derived columns:

FirstNameUpper, which features the first name entirely capitalized
FirstNameLower, which consists of the first name transformed entirely to lowercase

You may have to search around a bit to find the right function, 
HINT - try searching for what you're trying to do (say, convert text to uppercase)
in conjunction with the word "SQL".

       [FirstName]

	  ,[FirstNameLower] = LOWER([FirstName])
