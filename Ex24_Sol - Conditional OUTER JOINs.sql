/*
Exercise 1:

Create a query with the following columns:

 - SalesOrderID, OrderDate, and TotalDue from the "Sales.SalesOrderHeader" table
 - A derived column called "Percent of Sales YTD", calculated as follows:
		The value in the "TotalDue" column from Sales.SalesOrderHeader, 
		divided by the value in the "SalesYTD" field from the Sales.SalesPerson table, 
		then multiplied by 100.

**You can connect the two tables by the "SalesPersonID" and "BusinessEntityID" fields, respectively.

Return all rows from Sales.SalesOrderHeader that have a total due amount greater than $2,000, 
regardless of whether there is a sales person associated with the sale.

Sort the output by sales order ID, ascending.

SELECT
       A.[SalesOrderID]
      ,A.[OrderDate]

ORDER BY 1


/*
Exercise 2:

Modify your query from  Exercise 1 such that only records from Sales.SalesOrderHeader 
where the Sales YTD value is less than $2,000,000 are included. 
The overall number of records returned by your query should not change.

       A.[SalesOrderID]

ORDER BY 1


/*
Exercise 3:

Add the "SalesOrderDetailID" and "LineTotal" columns from the "Sales.SalesOrderDetail" table 
to your Exercise 2 query. Only include records in your output where a match is found in this query.

I'll leave it to you to figure out which field to join on (it's pretty intuitive).

NOTE - you are likely to find that the record count of your query increases substantially. This is because 
there is a one to many relationship between Sales.SalesOrderHeader and Sales.SalesOrderDetail, with each sales 
order being composed of potentially many individual items.
