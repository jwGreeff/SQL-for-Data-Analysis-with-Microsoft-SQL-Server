/*
Exercise 1:

Write a query that combines the "BusinessEntityID", "SalesQuota", and "SalesYTD" columns 
from the "Sales.SalesPerson" table, with the "Name" column from the "Sales.SalesTerritory" table. 
Alias the "Name" column as "TerritoryName".

Make sure to include all rows from the "Sales.SalesPerson" table 
regardless of whether a match is found in the "Sales.SalesTerritory" table. 
I'll leave it to you to determine which field to use to link the two tables together.

Change the join in your query from Exercise 2 from an outer join to an inner join,

Are the rows with NULL values in the "TerritoryName" column still being included?
