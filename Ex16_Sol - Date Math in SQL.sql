Use DATEDIFF to select all rows from the "Sales.SalesOrderHeader" table

Note that it is possible for DATEDIFF to output a negative number 
if the "end" date is prior to your "start" date, 
so you may want to use BETWEEN instead of <= in your criteria.

You may select all columns via the SELECT * shorthand.

Bonus:

Modify your query from Exercise 3 to work for ANY year, not just 2013. 
HINT - instead of hardcoding the year in your DATEFROMPARTS function, 
you will probably want to calculate the year based on the order date.
