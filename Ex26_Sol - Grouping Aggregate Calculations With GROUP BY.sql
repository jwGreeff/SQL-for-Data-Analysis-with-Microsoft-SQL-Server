Exercise 3:

You are not limited to only grouping by individual fields in your data; you can actually group by derived fields as well!
You just have to make sure that you include the same derived field in both your SELECT and GROUP BY.

With that in mind, "prettify" your output from Exercise 2 by displaying "No color" in the "Color" column 
in place of NULL values, and "NA" in the "Style" column in place of NULL values.

HINT: The ISNULL function could be handy here.
